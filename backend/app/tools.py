"""Local tools exposed to the LLM via function/tool calling.

- `escalate_and_capture_lead`: Capture high-value group booking leads or human agent requests,
  saving them to backend/data/leads.json and generating an escalation ticket reference.
- `search_web`: Fresh web-search fallback via Claude's web_search server-side tool. Used only
  when the KB and MCP catalog don't have an answer (e.g. current season status, weather,
  time-sensitive info). The system prompt tells the model to reach for it sparingly.

Live catalog/availability data (destinations, activities, real-time slots) comes from the
bucketlistt MCP server instead — see app/mcp_client.py. That client is deliberately
restricted to read-only tools; identity, cart, and payment tools are never loaded, so this
chatbot has no way to log a user in, touch a cart, or move money.
