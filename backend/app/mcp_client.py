"""Client for bucketlistt's live MCP server — catalog + auth + cart tier.

Whitelists browse tools (destinations, experiences, activities, slots, add-ons),
OTP-based auth (send_otp, verify_otp), and cart management (add_to_cart, get_cart,
update_cart_item, remove_from_cart), plus read-only get_my_bookings.

**Payment tools (create_payment_link, create_booking_order) remain excluded** —
the bot can build a cart for the user, but the actual charge happens on
bucketlistt.com, not through the chatbot. This keeps the money-moving surface
zero-sized while still letting the bot do the useful pre-checkout work.

The authToken from verify_otp flows through the conversation naturally — the
LLM sees it in the tool result and passes it into subsequent authenticated
tool calls. Each user's token is scoped to their conversation.

# ponytail: HTTP transport reuse was attempted here (a shared httpx.AsyncClient
# passed into streamablehttp_client's http_client= kwarg) but reverted after
# live testing — the installed mcp SDK (1.28.1) doesn't have an http_client
# parameter at all; it takes httpx_client_factory instead, and internally does
# `async with client:` on whatever the factory returns, closing it at the end
# of every single call. Passing a shared client through that factory would
# just get it closed after the first request, breaking every call after.
# Doing this correctly needs a wrapper client whose __aexit__ is a no-op (real
# close deferred to app shutdown) — untested complexity, not worth adding
# without dedicated test coverage. Upgrade path: revisit if a newer mcp SDK
# version supports passing an already-open client directly, or add the no-op
# wrapper with its own test once this optimization is worth the added risk.
